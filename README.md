# BlockLimit
I made this plugin for the official TNTC server. It's currently in use. The purpose of the mod is to limit the amount of blocks a person can place at any given time. 
- Configurable blocks, configurable instances. 



There is no documentation or support as this was a privately contracted project never meant to be shared publicly. This is now abandoned, and I do not plan to maintain it.
