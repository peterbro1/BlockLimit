# BlockLimit
I made this plugin for the official TNTC server. It's currently in use. The purpose of the mod is to limit the amount of blocks a person can place at any given time. 
- Configurable blocks, configurable instances. 


Won't add any maven scripts as I no longer support this plugin. Feel free to use it as a library
